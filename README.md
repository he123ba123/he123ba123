## About me

Hi there 👋. I’m Sagar Viradiya, a skilled and results-driven Android Developer with a strong background in Android app development and a passion for crafting high-quality apps and libraries. With a keen eye for quality and a deep understanding of the Android ecosystem, I build solutions that are not only functional but also delightful. Besides my 9to5, I love to give back to the community by blogging, speaking, and open-sourcing my ideas. My love for community led me to Google Developer Expert for Android. If I’m not crafting app/library then probably wondering about the universe’s existence.

- 👨‍💻 I’m currently a CCE student 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter
